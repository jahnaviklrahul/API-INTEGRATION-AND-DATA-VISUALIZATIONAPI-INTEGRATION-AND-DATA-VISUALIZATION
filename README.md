# Weather Dashboard Project

## Overview

The Weather Dashboard project is a simple Python application that fetches weather data from the *OpenWeatherMap API, processes it, and visualizes key weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The project uses the **requests* library to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API and utilizes *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn* for data visualization.

This project demonstrates how to:
- Fetch real-time weather data from an API
- Process and extract important weather information
- Visualize data using Python libraries

The goal of this project is to provide users with an intuitive way to monitor current weather conditions and explore data visualization techniques.

## Features
- *Real-time Weather Data Fetching*: The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a specified city.
- *Data Processing*: The app extracts essential weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and weather description.
- *Data Visualization*: The weather data is visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib in the form of bar charts, which display the temperature, humidity, and other key parameters.
- *Modular Codebase*: The project is split into multiple Python modules for better code organization:
  - fetch_weather.py: Fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
  - process_data.py: Processes the fetched data.
  - visualize_data.py: Visualizes the data using bar charts.
